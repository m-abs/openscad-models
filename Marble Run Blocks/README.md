# Marble run blocks - extras

These are extras for Marble Run Blocks by [WabbyStudio](https://cults3d.com/en/users/WabbyStudio/3d-models).

* [Marble Run Blocks - Starter pack](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/marble-run-blocks-starter-pack)
* [Marble Run Blocks - Extension pack](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/marble-run-blocks-extension-pack)
* [Marble Run Blocks - Medieval Castle pack](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/game/marble-run-blocks-medieval-castle-pack)

You won't find the models for the blocks here, you'll have to buy those yourself. They are well worth the price.

What you'll find here are extras that I made for myself.

## Models

### Extended build plate

The standard `Grid2x2` makes is more difficult to place the blocks, so I made larger version.

How to use this:

1. You need to copy the `MarbleRunBlocks-Grid2x2.stl`-file from the Starter pack into this folder
2. Modify the `x_repeats` and `y-repeats` variables to the desired size in `extended-build-plate.scad` and render it.

In my set I printed two 3 by 2 and two 3 by 4.
